const FAQ = () => {
  const faqs = [
    {
      question: "What kind of clients do you work with?",
      answer: "Individuals, couples, adolescents, and children (ages 8+), addressing a wide range of concerns including anxiety, depression, stress, trauma, relationship issues, behavioral problems, academic stress, and life transitions."
    },
    {
      question: "Do you offer online therapy?",
      answer: "Yes. Secure and confidential online sessions are available through encrypted, secure platforms. Online therapy offers the same level of professional care as in-person sessions, with the added convenience of attending from the comfort of your own space."
    },
    {
      question: "Are assessments valid for school or workplace use?",
      answer: "Yes, I use standardized tools with professional interpretation. All assessments are followed by detailed reports and professional feedback that can be used for academic planning, career development, or workplace accommodations when appropriate."
    },
    {
      question: "How should I prepare for the first session?",
      answer: "Just bring yourself. We'll begin with a relaxed, open conversation where we'll explore your concerns, background, and goals. There's no need to prepare anything specific - the first session is about getting to know each other and understanding how I can help you."
    },
    {
      question: "What is your confidentiality policy?",
      answer: "Your privacy is my top priority. All sessions are private and your information will never be shared without your written consent. Notes and records are stored securely and only accessible by me. Information shared in therapy is confidential, except in rare cases where there is risk of serious harm to you or someone else, if required by a court of law, or if there's a concern of abuse involving a child, elder, or vulnerable individual."
    },
    {
      question: "What are your cancellation policies?",
      answer: "Cancellations must be made at least 12 hours in advance. Late cancellations (under 12 hours) may be charged a 50% fee. No-shows may be charged in full. In the rare case I need to reschedule, I will notify you promptly."
    },
    {
      question: "How long are therapy sessions?",
      answer: "Most therapy sessions are 50-60 minutes long, though couple counseling sessions may be 60-75 minutes. Assessment sessions vary in length depending on the type of assessment - IQ and personality assessments typically take 2-3 hours, while emotional intelligence assessments take about 90 minutes."
    },
    {
      question: "Do you offer sessions in languages other than English?",
      answer: "Yes, I offer sessions in both English and Urdu. This allows me to work effectively with clients who are more comfortable expressing themselves in their native language."
    },
    {
      question: "What therapeutic approaches do you use?",
      answer: "I use evidence-based approaches including Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy (REBT), psychoeducation, insight-oriented therapy, mindfulness-based strategies, and child-centered play therapy for younger clients. The specific approach is tailored to your individual needs and goals."
    },
    {
      question: "How do I know if therapy is right for me?",
      answer: "Therapy can be beneficial for anyone experiencing emotional distress, relationship difficulties, life transitions, or simply wanting to understand themselves better. If you're considering therapy, it's often a sign that it could be helpful. The best way to know is to schedule an initial consultation where we can discuss your specific situation and determine if therapy would be beneficial for you."
